Victory and victory to you,
Oh darling daughter of the mountain,
Oh Goddess , whose splendour ,
Defeats the Sun with his thousand rays
Oh Goddess , who is saluted by the Sun,
Who has thousands of rays,
Oh Goddess who was praised,
By Tharakasura after his defeat,
In the war between him and your son,
Oh Goddess who was pleased with King Suratha,
And the rich merchant called Samadhi,
Who entered in to Samadhi,
And who prayed for endless Samadhi,
Oh Goddess who has captivating braided hair,
Who is the daughter of a mountain.
And who is the slayer of Mahishasura.
