Oh darling daughter of the mountain,
Please shower some mercy on me,
As you are most merciful on the oppressed.

To give me the independence ,
To consider you as my mother
And do not  reject my prayer even if it is improper,
But be pleased to drive away all my sorrows,
Oh Goddess who has captivating braided hair,
Who is the daughter of a mountain.
And who is the slayer of Mahishasura.

Jai Maa Durga !!
