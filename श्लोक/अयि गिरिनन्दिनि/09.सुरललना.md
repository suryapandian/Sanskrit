# सुरललना

```
सुरललना ततथेयि तथेयि कृताभिनयोदर नृत्यरते
कृत कुकुथः कुकुथो गडदादिकताल कुतूहल गानरते ।
धुधुकुट धुक्कुट धिंधिमित ध्वनि धीर मृदंग निनादरते
जय जय हे महिषासुरमर्दिनि रम्यकपर्दिनि शैलसुते ॥ ९ ॥

You who's praises are sung by people ever eager to praise You with charming words like ‘victory to You’, who captivate even Siva, the Lord of all beings with the clinging sound of Your anklets, who are fond of dancing with Siva in the sport in which He dances as Ardhanareeswara, You who have charming locks of hair, O Daughter of the Mountain, hail unto You, hail unto You.
