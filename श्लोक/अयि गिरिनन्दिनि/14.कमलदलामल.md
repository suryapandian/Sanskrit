कमलदलामल कोमलकान्ति कलाकलितामल भाललते
सकलविलास कलानिलयक्रम केलिचलत्कल हंसकुले ।
अलिकुलसङ्कुल कुवलयमण्डल मौलिमिलद्बकुलालिकुले
जय जय हे महिषासुरमर्दिनि रम्यकपर्दिनि शैलसुते ॥ १४ ॥

Victory and victory to you,
Oh darling daughter of the mountain,
Oh Goddess , whose spotless forehead,
Which is of delicate prettiness,
Is like pure and tender lotus leaf,
Oh Goddess who moves like the  spotlessly  pretty swans,
Which Move with delicate steps,
And which is  the epitome of arts,,
Oh Goddess ,Whose tress is surrounded
By bees from bakula trees,
Which normally crowd the tops of lotus flowers,
Oh Goddess who has captivating braided hair,
Who is the daughter of a mountain.
And who is the slayer of Mahishasura.
