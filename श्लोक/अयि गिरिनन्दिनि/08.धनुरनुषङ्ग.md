Victory and victory to you,
Oh darling daughter of the mountain,
Oh Goddess who decks herself with ornaments,
On her throbbing limbs in the field of battle,
When she gets her bow ready to fight,
Oh Goddess , who killed her enemies,
In the  field of battle with a shining sword,
And the shaking of her golden brown spots,
Oh Goddess , who made the battle ground of the four fold army,
In to a stage of drama with screaming little soldiers,
Oh Goddess who has captivating braided hair,
Who is the daughter of a mountain.
And who is the slayer of Mahishasura.


Cosmic battle: The imagery of the fourfold army and the battlefield as a stage suggests that this is not just a physical battle but a cosmic struggle between good and evil.
