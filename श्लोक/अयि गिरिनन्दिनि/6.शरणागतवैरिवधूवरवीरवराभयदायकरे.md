अयि (ayi): O!

शरणागतवैरिवधूवरवीरवराभयदायकरे (śaraṇāgata-vairi-vadhū-vara-vīra-vara-abhaya-dāyakare):

शरणागत (śaraṇāgata): those who have come for refuge (śaraṇa = refuge, āgata = come)
वैरि (vairi): enemy
वधू (vadhū): bride, wife
वर (vara): groom, husband
वीरवर (vīra-vara): best among heroes (vīra = hero, vara = best)
अभय (abhaya): fearlessness, protection from fear
दायक (dāyaka): giver, bestower
रे (re): (a vocative particle used to address someone)
Combined meaning: "O you who grant fearlessness to the best of heroes, who are the refuge for those who come seeking protection, and who destroy the enemies of your devotees!" - This portrays Durga as a compassionate protector who shelters those who seek her refuge and vanquishes those who threaten her devotees.
त्रिभुवनमस्तकशूलविरोधि-शिरोधिकृतामलशूलकरे (tribhuvana-mastaka-śūla-virodhi-śirodhikṛtāmala-śūla-kare):

शूल (śūla): trident, spear
विरोधि (virodhi): opposing, enemy
शिरोधिकृत (śirodhikṛta): placed on the head
अमल (amala): pure, spotless
शूलकरे (śūla-kare): one who holds a trident
Combined meaning: "O you who hold a pure trident on your head, which opposes the trident (symbolizing opposition) aimed at the head (leaders) of the three worlds!" - This complex imagery suggests that Durga protects the leaders and the order of the universe from those who oppose or threaten them. Her trident symbolizes her power to counteract any aggression aimed at the cosmic order.
दुमदुमितामरधुन्दुभिनाद-महोमुखरीकृतदिङ्मकरे (dumadumitāmara-dhundubhināda-maho-mukha-rīkṛta-diṅ-makare):

तामर (tāmara): a kind of drum
धुन्दुभि (dhundubhi): a type of celestial drum
नाद (nāda): sound
महोमुख (maha-mukha): great faces (referring to the mouths of the drum)
रीकॄत (rīkṛta): made, created
दिङ् (diṅ): direction
मकरे (makare): O you who have made!
Combined meaning: "O you who have made the directions resound with the loud sound of the celestial drums, Dumadumi and Dundubhi!" - This highlights the cosmic scale of Durga's actions and her power to influence the entire universe.
जय जय (jaya jaya):  victory, victory

हे (he):  O!

महिषासुरमर्दिनि (mahiṣāsura-mardini):  slayer of Mahishasura (the buffalo demon) (mahishasura = buffalo demon, mardini = slayer)

Oh Goddess who forgives and gives refuge,
To the heroic soldiers of the enemy rank,
Whose wives come seeking refuge for them,
Oh Goddess who is armed with trident ,
Ready to throw on the heads of those,
Who cause great pain to the three worlds,
Oh Goddess who shines likes the hot sun,
And who is aroused by sound of “Dhumi, Dhumi,”
Produced by the beating of drums by the devas,
