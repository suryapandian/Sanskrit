"O you with sweet thoughts, whose flute-playing surpasses the cooing of the cuckoo bird, putting it to shame! O you who have gone to the charming mountain groves, filled with the assembled Pulinda people, where the curved branches are colored with dye! O you who sport on the ground, surrounded by your own virtuous beings and the multitude of the great Shabari, adorned with good qualities! Victory, victory to you, O slayer of Mahishasura, with beautiful hair, daughter of the mountain!"



Victory and victory to you,
Oh darling daughter of the mountain,
Oh Goddess with sweet tender thoughts,
Whose sweet enchanting music,
Made through the flute in her hands,
Put the sweet voiced nightingale to shame,
Oh Goddess who stays in pleasant mountain groves,
Which resound with the voice of tribal folks,
Oh Goddess, whose playful stadium,
Is filled with flocks of tribal women,
Who have many qualities similar to her,
Oh Goddess who has captivating braided hair,
Who is the daughter of a mountain.
And who is the slayer of Mahishasura.
