करमुरलीरव वीजितकूजित लज्जितकोकिल मञ्जुमते
मिलितपुलिन्द मनोहरगुञ्जित रञ्जितशैल निकुञ्जगते ।
निजगणभूत महाशबरीगण सद्गुणसम्भृत केलितले
जय जय हे महिषासुरमर्दिनि रम्यकपर्दिनि शैलसुते ॥ १५ ॥

Victory and victory to you,
Oh darling daughter of the mountain,
Oh Goddess with sweet tender thoughts,
Whose sweet enchanting music,
Made through the flute in her hands,
Put the sweet voiced nightingale to shame,
Oh Goddess who stays in pleasant mountain groves,
Which resound with the voice of tribal folks,
Oh Goddess, whose playful stadium,
Is filled with flocks of tribal women,
Who have many qualities similar to her,
Oh Goddess who has captivating braided hair,
Who is the daughter of a mountain.
And who is the slayer of Mahishasura.
